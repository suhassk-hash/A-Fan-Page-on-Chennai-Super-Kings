    <h4 style="color: blue;">Chennai Super Kings Team Analysis</h4>

    <p style="color: 
rgb(156, 156, 66);"><strong>ESPNcricinfo' wrote "In the auction 2020, CSK got what they wanted. The team wisely chose Sam Curran and Josh Hazlewood for the Chennai pitch. Although some may say that Piyush Chawla was not included in the team, the franchise may have wanted more experience in the team and there would have been a better balance of Chawla as an alternative to Imran Tahir. Except for the lack of a left-arm fast bowler, the team does not have much problem."</strong></p>

Mumbai scored 162 runs with loss of 9 wickets. Chasing a target of 163, the team had lost two wickets in a first two overs, but Ambati Rayudu (71) and Faf du Plessis (58) brilliant inning and their century partnership (115-run) with Faf du Plessis, helped the Super Kings to beat the defending champions.

    <br>
    
     <br>  But in the course of the season Chennai Super Kings sufferred continuous defeats and were  out of the season  .After the continuous loss of the season and when there were no possible chances to win they won consecutive three matches with ruturaj coming into form and hitting consecutive three centuries and the only Chennai Super Kings batsman to do so in Indian Premiere Leauge ravindra jadeja had done a good job with the bat this season than with the ball scoring 30+ quickfire runs with and half-century and with a strike rate of 171.85 more than Pandya brothers,Pooran and many more.
     <br>
     <br>The most disappointing thing of the season was the batting of dhoni.Though he was at his best with the gloves,he was not as best as he was before with the bat.He was so disapponting in this year IPL.The bowling attack inconsistence was also the backdrop and many injuries to the players ,First match half centurion ,Ambati Rayudu was in jured and was out of 2 mathes and the champion DJ Bravo was also out of couple of mathes due to injury.Absence of Raina and Harbhjan was also a concern.After no chances to win ,in the last 3 mathes CSK management have decided to move seniors on to the bench and give the youngsters a chance ,as a preparation to the next IPL season.Youngsters also have proved themselves. <br>
     <br> They ended their season with a grand victory!!!
